# Antiope for Azure
Cloud Account & Resource Discovery tool - for Azure

This repo is a plugin to the Antiope Framework for discovering Azure Subscriptions (across multiple tenants) and the Virtual Machines (VMs) in those tenants. Eventually we may add more resource discovery like in AWS, but the primary purpose is to manage many subscriptions across multiple Tenants.

## Documentation
* See [AzureCredentials](docs/AzureCredentials.md) for setting up service principals to your multiple tenants
* See [AzureAntiopeInstall](docs/AzureAntiopeInstall.md) for installation insctuctions.
